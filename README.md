# Capgemini Website Redesign - Student Project  

## 🚀 About the Project  
This is a student project created during the first semester of my first year in the BUT Informatique program. The goal was to redesign the Capgemini website using the knowledge and tools we had at the time. It's a simplified version, focusing on design, structure, and basic functionality.

- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3**  

## 🌟 Features  
- Clean and semi-responsive design  
- Intuitive navigation bar  
- Imagined branding aligned with Capgemini's professional image  

## 📚 Learning Outcomes  
This project helped me:

## 💡 Next Steps
