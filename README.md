# Capgemini Website Redesign - Student Project  

## 🚀 About the Project  
This is a student project created during the first semester of my first year in the BUT Informatique program. The goal was to redesign the Capgemini website using the tools and techniques we had at the time.

One of the main requirements was to ensure that the site would be clear, easy to navigate, and understandable for middle school students (3ᵉ grade). The focus was on creating a simple, user-friendly design while practicing web development fundamentals.

- **CSS3**  

## 🌟 Features  
- Clean and semi-responsive design

## 📚 Learning Outcomes  
This project helped me:
